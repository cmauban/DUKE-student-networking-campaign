# “Dear Blue Devil” Campaign
Student Adoption of the Alumni Network

### Objectives:
* Design a landing page that will serve as the “front door” into the alumni network for undergraduate, graduate and professional students.
  * This page should be fun, interactive, hold attention of students--but also to educate and be useful to some degree. This is our chance to get students excited about networking and to teach them something about the possibilities awaiting them when they log in. 
* Launch a multi-phased, multi-platform marketing campaign that appeals to students and drives key network adoption criteria (logging in, searching for alumni, messaging alumni, completing a student profile, etc.)
* Drive success stories that instill our Forever Duke branding and the importance of the alumni community in the lives of students, i.e. create a way for students to build real relationships with alumni.
